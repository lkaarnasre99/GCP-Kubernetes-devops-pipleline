Let me break down each command:

1. `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`:
- Purpose: Configures kubectl to use a specific GKE cluster
- Real-world alternative: Using service accounts or cloud console UI

2. `kubectl config get-contexts` and `kubectl config use-context`:
- Purpose: List and switch between different Kubernetes clusters/environments
- Real-world alternative: Using separate kubeconfig files or tools like kubectx

3. `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace`:
- Purpose: Switch between namespaces (dev/prod environments)
- Real-world alternative: Tools like kubens or namespace prefixes in commands

4. `kubectl expose deployment`:
- Purpose: Creates a service to expose deployments externally
- Real-world alternatives:
  - Kubernetes YAML manifests
  - Helm charts
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
  - Ingress controllers

5. `kubectl get service`:
- Purpose: Verify service creation and get external IP
- Real-world alternatives:
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Cloud console UI
  - Automated health checks

These commands are typically automated in production using:
- CI/CD pipelines
- GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Custom scripts/tools
